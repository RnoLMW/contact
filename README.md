Hi. If this isn't your YouTube channel, please ignore this message. https://www.youtube.com/c/Doomwyte/ 
I just came across your "I've Been Delayed" video featuring music from TAS 1000. That band uploaded a few of their "deleted" songs and raw answering machine tape recordings on their website. Did you happen to download any of them, before the site went under around 2006? I'm looking for these in particular.

Songs:
"Beau-Mark VCR"
"Critique of Pure Reason"
"Dehumidifier"
"The Lost (and Atrocious) (and Glorious) Protein Shoes Horns"

Raw Tape Recordings:
Anything but "Delayed" and "Outgoing Message: Not A Real Person"

Thank you. Have a good day!
